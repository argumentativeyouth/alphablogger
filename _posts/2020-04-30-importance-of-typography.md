Until a few years back, I considered Typography as the most boring, monotonous and mundane element of design.

I could not understand how people spent so much of their time on something like creating their own typeface or improving the typography in a design.

It's not like I didn't know its importance. I knew that a typeface and its layout can make or break a design. From readability to aesthetics, typography plays a vital role, and I knew it. I could tell a bad typeface from a good one.

And yet it perplexed me, the huge number of *fonts *that exist*.*

My understanding of typography was limited. I had a very superficial knowledge of it. Typography, as my immature and ignorant mind perceived, lacked the shine and flexibility that playing with curves, shapes, and colours had. This mindset was the reason behind my lack of interest in understanding typography better.

I had a little theoretical understanding of it but that wasn't enough to feel the importance of typography, to understand its personality.

That, I believe, is the case with most of us. Typography isn't something people notice or pay attention to unless it is absolutely out of place with the rest of the design, unless people have to put effort to understand what is written, unless it is bad.

I mean, every one of us has come across amazing web pages - beautifully designed, great graphics, layout, great content - nothing out of place. But how many of us have exclaimed out loud, "That's a great font!"

Typography is underrated. Most of us do not realise the power of typography and its affect on us. And few of us can see the stories that they tell.

Recently, I came across this website called *[Types of Type](https://typesoftype.com/) *by Amanda Lui, a Los Angeles based graphic designer. Amanda also loves cultural comparisons.

These, her love for design and cultural comparisons, together gave birth to *Types of Type* where Amanda observes and presents beautifully the similarities between Korean and English language 'through the lense of typography'.

The beautifully designed website has seven chapters. The identification of similarities between the English and Korean alphabet, be it in typeface anatomy or the typefaces that look and express the same mood, has been done in a remarkably clever way.

Typography, indeed, tells stories.

That typography tells stories is scientifically proven as well, although I do not think 'storyteller' is the term they used :D

But researches have proved that skillful and proper use of typography can have an impact on the readers' feelings, emotions, mood, and their performance in other activities, just like stories. For example, after reading something where a good typography has been used, people perform creative tasks better.

The power and impact of typography go beyond improving readability. Just like other essential elements of design, typography plays a crucial role, that has a deep, psychological effect, something that we do not even recognise initially.

Readability is just one reason why typography is important and that itself has multiple dimensions. From establishing a hierarchy in the way information is delivered to maintaining the overall harmony, typography has a role to play. And as mentioned above, skillful use of typography can set up the right mood in audience, which, in turn, can help in holding their attention. Not to say, it helps in brand recognition as well.

Oh yes, typography is powerful and they tell stories :)
