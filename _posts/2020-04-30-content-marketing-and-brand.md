Brand! We use this word very frequently in our day-to-day life! But what exactly does the word mean?

"That's a branded T-Shirt!," we say. The statement means that the T-Shirt has a brand name associated with it which makes it special, more valuable.

But there is a question. How is this branded T-Shirt different from a generic T-Shirt? Why does being associated with a "brand" make a certain product or even service more valuable to us?

Is it because the branded T-Shirt has a manufacturer's tag attached to it? Let's say it does have a manufacturer's tag although you have never heard of the name before. Would you still call it branded? No, right?

Is it because of the way the T-Shirt looks? Let's say the generic T-Shirt looks exactly the same as the branded T-Shirt. Does that make it branded? Nope.

So, is it because of the way it feels when you touch the branded T-Shirt? Let's say the generic T-Shirt is made of the same material as the branded one. And again, it is not a branded T-Shirt.

If it's neither the the manufacturer's name, look and feel of the T-Shirt, what exactly makes the Â generic T-Shirt 'generic' and the branded one 'branded'?

While the manufacturer's name, the look and feel of the T-Shirt definitely add value to the T-Shirt, what makes a T-Shirt branded and the name of the manufacturer a brand is something more.

A brand is more than the physical and tangible qualities of a product/service.\
For the generic T-Shirt that has a quality, even unique look and feel, to become a branded T-Shirt, there should be an emotional connect existing between the name of the manufacturer and the buyers.

This doesn't happen in a day. This emotional connect is built over time.

Delivery of quality, unique products/services gives consumers good experiences, which is the first step towards the birth of a brand. This, when happens consistently over a period of time, creates an impression of the manufacturer/service provider in the minds of the consumers.

Eventually, this impression, this amalgamation of experiences - mass experiences and memories to be precise - and the associated stories, together weave a relationship that, like any other relationship, is built upon expectations and trust. An emotional connect is established, and a brand is born.

This concept of 'Brand' is lacking in most of the content marketing that we see today. Content marketing strategies, doesn't matter what you are marketing, should be aligned with the vision of the company and not be directed towards desperate marketing of the product or service.
